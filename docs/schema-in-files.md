# Defining entity schemas in json files

You can define entity and its columns right on the model, using decorators. 
But some people prefer to defined entity and its columns inside separate files
which are called in TypeORM "entity schemas".
In TypeORM you can define entity schemas in `js`, `json` files.

TBD.
