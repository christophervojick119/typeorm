# Usage in the browser and Cordova
The standard `typeorm` package also supports browser usage and can also be used in cordova based projects (cordova, phonegap, ionic).
The package includes two ways to use in the browser

## SystemJS
If you want to use SystemJS as a module loader than three precompiled files are included for you to use.
```
- typeorm-browser.js
- typeorm-browser.min.js (Minified version)
- typeorm-browser.js.map (Sourcemap)
```
Since these files are generated by the TypeScript compiler they are affected by the [issue, that SystemJS 0.20 does not support them](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/issues/1587). When using SystemJS@0.19.47 everything works.
For an example see [typeorm/browser-example](https://github.com/typeorm/browser-example).

## ES2015 Module
In the `browser` folder the package also includes a version compiled as a ES2015 module. If you want to use a different loader this is the point to start. The package is setup in a way that loaders like webpack will automatically use the `browser` folder.

## Cordova/Phonegap
Thanks to the [cordova-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage) plugin, TypeORM can also run in a Cordova or Phonegap app, where you again have the option to choose between module loaders. For an example see [typeorm/cordova-example](https://github.com/typeorm/cordova-example).
